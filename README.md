# PrioBorrow
 
Code repository for the simulations done in order to make the 2^nd^ paper of the thesis.

Folders:

- Archives: Old versions of reports and code
- R: R code
    - GenFigures.R ==> generate figures for chosen scenarios
    - GetOC.R ==> all function to simulate data and analyse them with the different explored models
    - TestPriorBOP.R ==> simulate the scenarios with different modification of the manner to compute posterior probability
    - TestPriorServeur.R ==> experimentation to replicate different prior borrowing techniques
- Rapports: the reports
